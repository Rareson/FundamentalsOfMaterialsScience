FundamentalsOfMaterialsScience
==============================

Programs created for homework of Fundamantals of Materials Science course.

These scripts are written in Matlab. However if you currenlty have no Matlab installed
on your machine, you can use GNU Octave instead or even the online IDE (http://www.compileonline.com/).

If you are not familiar with Matlab, you can learn it with tutorialspoint (MATLAB Tutorial
